        <h1>Decrypting the 'Ghost in the Wires' ciphers</h1>
        <p class="last-update">Last update on November 2019.</p>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Before I was even done reading <a
                    href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10256723-ghost-in-the-wires" target="_blank">Ghost in the
                    Wires</a>, I had to start deciphering the "quizzes" that introduce each chapter.</p>
            <p>Apparently they weren't included in every edition of the book, so I guess I was lucky to pick up the 2011
                paperback.</p>
            <p>I know there are probably millions of solutions online, but I really wanted to see if I could solve them
                on my own.</p>
            <p>During the next few weeks I hope I can find more and more solutions.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 1 | Rough Start</h3>

            <button class="show-hide-btn" onclick="toggleVisibility('solution1')">Show/Hide solution</button>
            <div id="solution1" style="display: none;" class="solution">
                <p>Just by looking at the text we get the feeling that it's a valid sentence:
                    <ul>
                        <li>it starts with an uppercase letter;</li>
                        <li>all the characters are letters;</li>
                        <li>there are longer words separated by shorter words, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    So, it was only natural that the cipher was a simple ROT, which I quickly checked
                    using <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/" target="_blank">CyberChef</a>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cipher: ROT7</li>
                    <li>Question: The cost of the bus driver I used to punch my own transfers.</li>
                    <li>Solution: $15</li>
                </ul>

            <div id="solution2" style="display: none;" class="solution">
                <p>Again, the text looked like a valid sentence, so basically the same as the previous answer just with a different shift.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cipher: ROT15</li>
                    <li>Question: This book that taught me how to create new identities when I was a pre-teen.</li>

            <div id="solution3" style="display: none;" class="solution">
                <p>The uppercase letter at the end of the sentence made me think the chars were reversed.</p>
                <p>After that, it was just a matter of finding the shift for the ROT Cipher once again, which turned out to be 3, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT_cipher" target="_blank">Ceaser Cipher</a>.</p>
                <ul>

                <p>This one was pure trial and error, I assumed the ciphers would get progressively harder so I just tried one of the simplest, <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash">Atbash</a>, aka, the alphabet backwards.</p>
