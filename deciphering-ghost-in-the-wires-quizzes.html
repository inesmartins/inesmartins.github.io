        <h1>Decrypting the 'Ghost in the Wires' ciphers</h1>
        <p class="last-update">Last update on November 2019.</p>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>Before I was even done reading <a
                    href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10256723-ghost-in-the-wires" target="_blank">Ghost in the
                    Wires</a>, I had to start deciphering the "quizzes" that introduce each chapter.</p>
            <p>Apparently they weren't included in every edition of the book, so I guess I was lucky to pick up the 2011
                paperback.</p>
            <p>I know there are probably millions of solutions online, but I really wanted to see if I could solve them
                on my own.</p>
            <p>During the next few weeks I hope I can find more and more solutions.</p>

            <h3>Chapter 1 | Rough Start</h3>
            <p>Max vhlm hy max unl wkboxk B nlxw mh ingva fr hpg mktglyxkl</p>
            <button class="show-hide-btn" onclick="toggleVisibility('solution1')">Show/Hide solution</button>
            <div id="solution1" style="display: none;" class="solution">
                <p>Just by looking at the text we get the feeling that it's a valid sentence:
                    <ul>
                        <li>it starts with an uppercase letter;</li>
                        <li>all the characters are letters;</li>
                        <li>there are longer words separated by shorter words, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    So, it was only natural that the cipher was a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher" target="_blank">Ceaser Cipher</a>, which I quickly checked
                    using <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/" target="_blank">CyberChef</a>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cipher: ROT 7</li>
                    <li>Question: The cost of the bus driver I used to punch my own transfers</li>
                    <li>Solution: $15</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Chapter 2 | Just Visiting</h3>

            <button class="show-hide-btn" onclick="toggleVisibility('solution2')">Show/Hide solution</button>
            <div id="solution2" style="display: none;" class="solution">
                <p>Again, the text looks like a valid sentence, so basically the same as the previous answer.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cipher: ROT 15</li>
                    <li>Question: This book that taught me how to create new identities when I was a pre-teen.</li>

            <div id="solution3" style="display: none;" class="solution">
                <p>The uppercase letter at the end of the sentence made me think the chars were reversed. After that, it was just a matter of finding the shift for the Ceaser Cipher once again.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cipher: Reverse | ROT 3</li>
                    <li>Question: These older type of devices were used to call forward business lines to answering
                        services.</li>
